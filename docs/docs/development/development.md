# Development and Community

As an open-source project, **RepLAB** relies on a community of users to keep get better and develop in relevant directions. The project is generously hosted on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/replab/replab). The easiest way to contribute is by sharing a suggestion or reporting an issue [directly online](https://www.github.com/replab/replab/issues/new). Anyone with a github account can do that (an account can be easily created). Every contribution is valued.

Further tools and guidelines useful for development can be found here:

 - A description of [abbreviations](abbreviations.html) used by the library
 - A short description of the [law checking](../publish/LawChecks.html) framework
 - A presentation of the [pretty printing](../publish/PrettyPrinting.html) mechanism
 - A succint presentation of the [code scructure organization](organization.html)
 - A description of the [API documentation style](api_documentation_style.html)
