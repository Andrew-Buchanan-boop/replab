Version 1

- representations to be decomposed need to be exact

- continuous representations are experimental

- tolerances are magic, but all uses of tolerances are documented

- no propagation of errors with objects

- support for nonunitary representations (not necessarily decomposition or SDPs)

Version 2

- continuous representations are supported with proper error estimates

- objects store a measure of their precision, and all methods propagate such errors (with optional input and output arguments), NaN signals missing information

- no magic tolerances anymore

- a decision is made for non-exact representations (use of symbolic toolbox? implementation of cyclotomic/algebraic field? GEM?)

- full support for nonunitary representations
