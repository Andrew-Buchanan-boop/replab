%% Relabelings in the CHSH scenario
%
% We describe the output/input/party relabelings in the CHSH scenario,
% and decompose their action on probability distributions $P(ab|xy)$.
%

%% Relabelings the outputs
% Outputs are binary, so the relabelling of outputs is the symmetric group
% of domain size 2. The representation of this relabelling on the
% probabilities $P(a)$ is then the defining representation
outputGroup = replab.S(2);
outputRep = outputGroup.definingRep;

%% Adding the relabelings of inputs
% In the CHSH scenario, each party has two binary measurements. Therefore,
% a copy of S(2) acts on the outputs of the first measurement, and a second
% copy of S(2) acting on the outputs of the second measurement, while
% another copy of S(2) permutes the choice of measurement (input).
%
% This is described by the wreath product of S(2) by S(2).
ioGroup = replab.S(2).wreathProduct(outputGroup);
%%
% The representation on the conditional probility $P(a|x)$ is the
% imprimitive representation, given that we use the defining representation
% for the inner group
ioRep = ioGroup.imprimitiveRep(outputRep);

%% Adding the relabelings of parties
% The same story repeats for relabelings of parties: the scenario involves
% two homogeneous parties. We thus have two copies of the group relabeling
% inputs and/or outputs (one for Alice, one for Bob), and a copy of S2 that
% permutes the parties. This group desribing all possible relabellings in
% this scenario is thus given by:
scenarioGroup = outputGroup.wreathProduct(ioGroup);
%%
% The representation on the behavior $P(ab|xy)$ is however a primitive
% representation, as $P(a|x; b|y)$ ressembles a tensor. Inside each party,
% we use the imprimitive representation constructed before.
probRep = scenarioGroup.primitiveRep(ioRep);

%% Decomposition of the full probability space
% We can now compute the decomposition of this representation on $P(ab|xy)$:
dec = probRep.decomposition
%%
% There are 6 irreducible componenta
dec.nComponents

% These components correspond to the following physical elements (see
